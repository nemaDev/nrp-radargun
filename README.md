HOW TO INSTALL (ESX):

2.) Place the following into ox_inventory/data/weapons.lua:

		['WEAPON_RADARGUN'] = {
			label = 'Pistola radar',
			weight = 100,
			durability = 0.1,
		},

3.) Drag and drop the qb-inventory folder provided into the [esx] folder. If you're using some other inventory script other than ox_inventory, just place the image where the images go for that respective script.

4.) Drag the nrp-radargun into your [esx] folder. This resource should still work standalone. If you are using this standalone, just drag and drop into your resource directory, and type "ensure nrp-radargun" in your server.cfg.-
